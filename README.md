<h2>Web Pack</h2>
<p>
WebPack - is simple s static module bundle. Static since it does not run the code in every module it traverses but simple 'collects them in their proper order and places them into (usually) one bundle.
Under the hood it depends on a dependancy graph, a description of how modules relate with one another using references  (require and import statements) between files.</p>
